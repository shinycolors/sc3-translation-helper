# SC3 Translation Helper (or SC3TH for short)

Following the development of the Chrome/Firefox extension it became clear that there's quite a long way to go when it comes into translating the commus and we're currently not able to get/translate the 100% of them. We deeply appreciate your help in providing the dialog files/text's and of course we appreciate if you can help with their translation, too.

With that in mind, we've created this small utility to assist even more in the process of translation. You will be able to drop or select a .json file containing such dialogs (in the proper format) and focus just in the translating part, with no long scroll views or small fonts.

### FEATURES
  * Load/Export dialog files.
  * Romaji reading and aproximated translation*.
  * Spellcheck*.
  * Dialog count.
  * Keyboard shortcuts.
  * **more to come**

**Currently, it only supports english for translation and spellcheck dictionaries.*
